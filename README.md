# SWDV-691-Capstone-Project
 Capstone Project creating a countertop field measuring tool.

This tool will allow for the field measure team to log countertop measures virtually via mobile device. It will have a log of the active jobs and information relavant to those jobs. It will allow for the field measure team to add countertops and all features included with them (style, dimensions, accessories, etc) as they walk through the building. Upon completing, it will create entries within the database to keep a file of the information, and then email it to the LES PM assigned to the job. 

This will help with accuracy and efficiency for measured jobs.
